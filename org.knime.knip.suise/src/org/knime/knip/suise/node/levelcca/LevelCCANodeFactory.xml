		<intro>
			Thresholdes the input images at multiple levels and
			performs a
			connected component analysis for each. The result is a
			labeling
			presumbly with many overlapping segments. If two subsequent
			threshold
			levels would result in the same connected components (i.e.
			the binary
			images are equal) one of them will be neglected and not added twice.
