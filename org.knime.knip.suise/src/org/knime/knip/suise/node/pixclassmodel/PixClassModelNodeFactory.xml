		<intro>
			Generates from a list of
			<i>feature images</i>
			and
			<i>labelings</i>
			a pixel
			classification model.

			The labeling determines the class of each
			pixel. A feature image is an
			image of at least three dimension whereof
			exactly one dimension
			represents the pixel features, i.e. a vector of
			numbers describing a
			pixel. A feature image can be generated by
			composing outcomes of
			arbritrary image filter nodes (using the
			Merger
			node, for instance) or
			by using dedicated pixel features nodes (e.g.
			Fiji
			Trainable
			Segmentation Features-node).

				in a way such that for each class (label) more or less the same
				amount of samples (pixels) are chosen.</option>
