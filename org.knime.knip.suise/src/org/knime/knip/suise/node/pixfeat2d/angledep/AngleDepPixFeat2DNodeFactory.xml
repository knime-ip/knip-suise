	<name>Angle-Dependent Pixel Features 2D</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Node to calculate angle-dependent pixel features.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Node to calculate angle-dependent pixel features. The pixel
			features are
			represented in a feature image with two additional
			dimensions: one
			for the features and the other for the orientations
			(angles). Hence each pixel (X,Y) has a specific value for a certain
			feature (F) and a certain angle/orientation (O).
			In conjunction with
			polygons (represented by a labeling) these features can be used to
			create a boundary model (with the according node).
		</intro>
		<tab name="Features">
			<option name="Gabor feature set">Gabor filters of the given radius are convolved
				with the source image for the specified number of orientations. Each
				combination of the parameters scales, frequencies and elongations
				(comma separated list of real numbers) is a new "point" in the
				feature dimenion (for the given number of orientations).
			</option>
			<option name="Line feature set">For the given number of orientations all the
				pixel values along a line through a pixel a considered as a
				individual feature. Hence, a radius of 10 leads to 2*10+1 features
				for the specified number of orientations.</option>

		<tab name="Additional settings">
			<option name="Number of orientations">The features are calculated for the specifed
				number of orientations, equally distributed over 360Â°.</option>
			<option name="Orientation dimension label">The label/name of dimension representating the

			<option name="Column Creation Mode">
				Mode how to handle the selected column. The
				processed column can be
				added to a new table, appended to the end of
				the table, or the old
				column can be replaced by the new result</option>
			<option name="Column suffix">
				A suffix appended to the column name. If "Append"
