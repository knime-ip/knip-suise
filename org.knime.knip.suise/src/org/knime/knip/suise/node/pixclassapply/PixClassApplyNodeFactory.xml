		<intro>
			Classifies a
			<i>feature image</i>
			with the given pixel classification model.
			A feature image is an
			image
			of at least three dimension whereof
			exactly
			one dimension
			represents the
			pixel features, i.e. a vector of
			numbers
			describing a
			pixel. A feature
			image can be generated by
			composing
			outcomes of
			arbritrary image filter
			nodes (using the
			Merger
			node, for
			instance) or
			by using dedicated pixel
			features nodes (e.g.
			Fiji
			Trainable
			Segmentation Features-node). The
			feature image should be of
			the same structure as used to train the
			pixel classification model.
